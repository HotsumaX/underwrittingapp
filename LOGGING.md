## Logging and Error Handling

### Logging Configuration
- Logs are configured using the `logging_config.py` module.
- Logs are written to both the console and `app.log` file.

### Usage
- Import and setup logging in your module:
  ```python
  import logging
  from logging_config import setup_logging

  setup_logging()
  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
  ```

### Error Handling
- Use try-except blocks to catch and log errors.
- Ensure meaningful error messages are raised or returned.
